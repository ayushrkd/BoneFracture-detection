 Bone Fracture Detection!

 I used a custom dataset along with YOLO, Ultralytics, OpenCV (cv2), and cvzone to train the model in 45 epochs with promising results. This project has great potential in medical imaging and could be further developed for faster diagnosis and wider healthcare applications.
